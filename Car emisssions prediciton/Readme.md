# Statement

This dataset captures the details of how CO2 emissions by a vehicle can vary with the different features. The dataset has been taken from the Canada Government's official open data website. This is a compiled version. This contains data over a period of 7 years.

There is a total of 26075 rows and 15 columns. There are a few abbreviations that have been used to describe the features. I am listing them out here. The same can be found in the Data Description sheet.

Model

4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive

AWD = All-wheel drive

FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle

SWB = Short wheelbase

LWB = Long wheelbase

EWB = Extended wheelbase

Transmission
A = Automatic

AM = Automated manual

AS = Automatic with select shift

AV = Continuously variable

M = Manual

3 - 10 = Number of gears

Fuel type
X = Regular gasoline

Z = Premium gasoline

D = Diesel

E = Ethanol (E85)

N = Natural gas

Fuel Consumption
City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per gallon (mpg)

CO2 Emissions
The tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometer) for combined city and highway driving

Smog Rating
The tailpipe emissions of smog-forming pollutants are rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The data has been taken and compiled from the below Canada Government official link - "https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6"

QUESTIONS
Determine or test the influence of different variables on the emission of CO2 and the smog ratings.

What are the influencing features that affect CO2 emission and smog ratings the most?

Will there be any difference in the CO2 emissions when Fuel Consumption for City and Highway is considered separately and when their weighted variable interaction is considered?
